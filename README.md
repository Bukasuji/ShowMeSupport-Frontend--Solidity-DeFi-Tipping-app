# Go support me

 This is a decentralized finance application that allows users to easily give financial support to the owner and can leave a message of encouragement for the person. This app solves the problem of centralized financial systems, which can be slow, expensive, and restrictive, especially when it comes to small transactions like tipping. With this app, users can easily send small amounts of cryptocurrency to support someone and show their appreciation, without having to worry about high fees or middlemen.

## How The App Works:

- Connect your wallet and get ready to spread some love.
- Input your cool and unique nickname or username in the "name" field to show off your personality.
- Leave an awesome message on the message field to inspire and uplift the person you're supporting.
- Input the amount of support you want to show in the "support" field. One support equals 0.001 ETH, so the more support you show, the bigger your impact.
- Click the "Show Support" button and watch as your support is instantly sent, spreading positivity and good vibes all around.
